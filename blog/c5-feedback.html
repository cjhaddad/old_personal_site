    <h1>Experiences with Pairing and Feedback</h1>

       No time is wasted in DBC's Phase 0 to introduce noobs to pairing and giving and receiving feedback. I knew these were aspects of the DBC method and experiences, but I really had no clue how much of the experience they are. My first pairing experience was a guided pairing session with a DBC Phase 0 guide. I was totally nervous going in, for I imagined to almost be a test. Happily, I quickly realized that was not the case. Instead, it was a really great mode of working through a problem with a peer and having a guide there as a resource. During my most recent GPS experience I definitely felt some nerves about being evaluated creep back in, for when my pair and I ran into errors I felt flustered. On the topic of pairing AND feedback, my guide for this GPS gave me really helpful feedback and a reminder that "errors are natural part of life"..she went on to write..."in the coding process." To me the last phrase could just as easily be left off, but having it there also keeps this great reminder specific to this learning and coding experience.

         Generally, I have found pairing really awesome. I learn so much from my cohort and have loved the social aspect this gives Phase 0. I find that through the medium of conversation I am both learning from my pair and from myself as I put into words my ideas and verbalize my questions. Even when I encounter a peer who seems to be not very enthusiastic about pairing in general, I find myself learning not only a new aspect of whatever topic we are dealing with, but also about how to interact with diverse perspectives. It can be trying, yet nonetheless productive in potentially many ways.

        A few more words on feedback -- as I mentioned in my very first cultural blog post, I was and continue to be appreciative of the strong emphasis DBC places on feedback and their ASK (Actionable, Specific, Kind) model for giving feedback. As a teacher and Ph.D. student I gave and received a TON of feedback. The model I was working with was more often than not in the format of a "shit sandwhich," where there were positive ends surrounding a negative middle, which ultimately made most of the feedback seem disingenuous. I really recognize the value in disregarding this format and working in the ASK model. Nevertheless, breaking out of old habits of writing feedback is challenging. I find that when I have something more critical to say, I am overthinking how to convey my thoughts without being rude, but still kind and honest. The providing of feedback was a huge part of my past as a teacher and the models I replicated from professors were in the shit-sandwhich vein and often were not always constructively critical. Therefore, I'm working through shifting my mode of giving feedback.
