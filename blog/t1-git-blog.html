        Week numero uno of the 2015 Pocket Gophers' Phase 0 is coming to an end. It's time to reflect on what we learned. For clarity and structure's sake I'll address DBC's prompts throughout. The prompts are as follows: "What are the benefits of version control?"; "How does git help you keep track of changes?"; "Why use GitHub to store your code?"
      </p>
      <p>
          As someone who just finished writing a dissertation, the benefits of version control ARE SO OBVIOUS to me now that I wish I could go back in time and teach my three-years-ago self Git. Alas, I'm still waiting for Dr. Emmett Brown to show up with his DeLorean. Lucky for me (and seriously I realize I am so lucky to be doing this bootcamp) DBC is teaching me the ins-and-outs of version control so my future self can be spared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the context of source code files, I'll explain my understanding of version control benefits. Whether you're working on software source code files by yourself or as a member of a team, version control gives you the ability to save multiple versions of your file(s) as you make changes to it. This allows you to channel your inner Doc Brown and track your file(s) and check out past versions of your source code. Therefore, if the current version of your code is having issues running or encoutnering any type of issue, you can revert back to a different version. Git is version control software that runs locally on your computer and gives you the ability to create repositories on your computer and then track the files within them. Using git software provides an easy and streamlined way of working with one file or multiple files and log the various changes you make to it and, then, review, revert, or recover its past versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can't begin to tell you how much better and easier working with git is than when I was saving different files of my dissertation and trying to piece together at times what changed from one file to another (my eyes are going crossed just thinking about it). Git is not of course only helpful when you're working on a solo project, but also when you are working on a team. This is where GitHub comes in. GitHub is a web app that works with your local git software to publish and share repositories. When repositories are online, they are able to be shared among however many people are allowed or want access to it. This makes sharing and tracking source code files easy for team-based projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, say there are three people working on one project. Each of these three people can fork the repository to their own GitHub account and clone this repository to their local computer. Each person can simultaneously be working on the same source code files without fear that the changes they are making will somehow interfere with another person's changes. This is done by each person working on a "branch" of the repository. When each person is finished with their changes and want to reconcile what they did with the "trunk"/ master repository and other branches of the repository, they will push their changes to GitHub and merge their changes. If there are merge conflicts between changes, they will be prompted to settle each. And this in a nutshell is why GitHub is a great way to store code.
