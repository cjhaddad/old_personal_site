      <h1>Diversity in Tech</h1>
      <h2> <!-- insertsubtitle --></h2>
      <h4>February 28, 2015</h4>

      <section>
        <p>
         Diversity, or lack there of, in the tech industry is a topic that seems incredibly pervasive and prolific at this moment. I believe this is especially true since the release of <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/">data from major tech companys</a> about their employees' racial and gender identities. As someone who is immensely dedicated to racial and gender equality and social justice issues, this problem is not a new idea to me and something that I am already actively working toward remedying (e.g., over this past summer I co-founded the Chicago chapter of <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a>).
       </p>
         <p>
          Computers and software are a ubitutous aspect of living in the 21st Century, where people from all walks of life use and consume digital media and technologies. Therefore, people from all walks of life should also be at the helm of creating and producing software and the Web. The topic of diversity in tech and the reasons it came to be and how it can be remedied can hardly be fleshed out and analyzed in this short blog post. Nonetheless, I begin to discuss it and plan to continue to contemplate and understand how to make the tech industry not only more accessible space for women and people of color, but also a healthy and stable space for women and people of color to thrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the best articles I have read about the how and why of women specifically not being in tech is an NPR piece from October 2014 titled <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding">When Women Stopped Coding</a>. Women were pioneers in computer programming and computer science, but something happened (speculation abounds) in the early 1980s, where a steep drop-off in the number of women majoring in computer science occurs. The driving question behind the NPR article is 'what happened?' And, like any cultural trend, there is not a single straightforward answer, but rather it is a complicated intertwined set of ideological and sociological circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          As noted by the NPR article, the marketing of the first personal computer in the early to mid-80s featured men and boys prominently and in a sense masculinized the ownership and usage of personal computers. Of course, there is no inherent, biological reason why this was the case and why men, especially white men, are and have dominated the tech industry. The cultural ramifications of these early popular cultural portrayls of men and boys as the "natural" users of personal computers continue to be pervasive in dominant understandings and ideas concerning who is and is not technologically competant. Ignoring these popular representations and conceptions of computer use would deny a major ideological facet of the tech industry that had and continues to have serious repercussions in terms of hiring practices, education, and tech culture.
        </p>
        <p> A pleathora of ideas and opinions are circulating as to how to make the tech industry and computer programming education more socially just and accessible to women and people of color. Certainly, cultural and ideological shifts can occur by documenting the experiences of women and people of color currently working in the tech industry, representing women and people of color as active users and producers of computers in popular culture, and then backing this up with very real and necessary monetary and emotional support to keep them in the industry. Making STEM education more accessible and supportive to women and people of color is often touted as a primary means to this end. And while I agree with this to an extent, I also believe this argument ignores and surpresses the very real advantage of valuing liberal arts and humanities education and the immense impact of including people from diverse education backgrounds can have on tech industry culture and the technologies being created.</p>
        <p>
          Therefore, I believe the STEM education argument needs to shift to an argument and approach that is more about radicalizing and changing education in general that values both STEM AND Liberal Arts and Humanities and thefore de-masculinizes STEM and de-feminizes the Humanities. At the very least this would start at revamping undergraduate university education and the prereqs that are required for every student, regardless of their desired major. This means STEM majors taking a women and gender studies course, an ethnic studies course, a media studies course, and other similar, culturally-minded courses that bring an element of understanding and empathy to those from backgrounds different from one's own. This ALSO means Liberal Arts-majors taking computer programming courses, statistics courses, and the like to provide a technical grounding in putting into practice their more theoretically-based education. This is purely a first stab at considering what specifically can and needs to change in both our calls for and implementations of education reform. I very much plan to develop these ideas further.
