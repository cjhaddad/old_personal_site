      <h2>Musings on My Thinking Style</h2>
      <h4>February 21, 2015</h4>

      <section>
        <p>
         Never before had I considered what my thinking style was and how it could and has affected my learning processes. Retrospectively, this seems crazy, given the fact that I just finished a Ph.D. I went 30ish years, 24ish of which I was in some kind of student role, without this bit of self-awareness! Particularly as a graduate student, I could have benefited from understanding this facet of myself and the idea that this facet can grow, change, and adapt. Harping on what could/ should/ would doesn't help me right now so much, aside from the appreciation of having this newfound self-information. So, needless to say, this Abstract-Random thinker with Concrete Random tendencies (Abstract Sequential was in a close third!), is looking forward to understanding my thinking style more in-depthly and considering the ways to adapt and incorporate other modes of thinking and processing information.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, a little about what it means to have an inclination toward an Abstract Random thinking style: "This learner likes to listen to others, bringing harmony to group situations, establishing healthy relationships with others, focusing on the issues at hand"; "They learn best when in a personalized environment, given broad or general guidelines, able to maintain friendly relationships, able to participate in group activities"; "What's hard for them? Having to explain or justify feelings, competition, working with dictorial/ authoritarian personalities, working in a restrictive environment, working with people who don't seem friendly, concetrating on one thing at a time, giving exact details, accepting even positive criticism." (Resource: <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm</a>) Following pretty closely behind my Abstract Random thinking orientation is the Concrete Random thinking style. After reviewing aspects to this thinking style, the following particularly sticks out to me: "use their intuition, they are able to use trial-and-error approaches, takes risks, dislikes having no restrictions and limitations."
        </p>
        <p>
          Alright, so taking all of this information into consideration, I do indeed resonate with these two thinking styles quite a bit. I recognize how I do emphasize verbal and non-verbal communication -- talking AND listening, group projects and community, freedom of expression, experimentation, intuition, and a healthy, open work environment. Admittedly, I realize I generally named off a lot of strengths to these thinking styles that connect with me. But what about areas of growth? Can't recognize strengths without weakness! Because then that's implicitly saying there is no room for growth, and there's always room for growth! What fun would life be if there weren't obstables and opportunities to grow and learn?
        </p>
        <p>
          When I pull back and review the Gregorc thinking styles, I see acceptance of criticism (positive and negative) as the major area where I know I have room to grow. As I reflect on Phase 0 thus far, I absolutely see how this fear of criticism has crept in for me. I love DBC's strong emphasis on feedback. I recognize the immense impact solid feedback can have for an individual and community, for I have witnessed how good (and good not necessasarily meaning positive) feedback and constructive criticism has benefited me and whatever I was working on at that moment. Nevertheless, I know I have a tendency to view feedback and critique as evidence of my percieved deficiencies. This mental tendency operates from a static, fixed mindset where a belief in a predetermined mental capacity and intellect reigns. I do indeed believe in everyone's infinite ability to develop intellectually, emotionally, phsycially, spiritually, etc. Often, as the phrase "follow your own advice" simply alludes to, I can subscribe to the growth mindset quite logically, yet in practice my mental habits/ blocks can encroach upon my desires to move beyond it and, therefore, hinder my ability to receive feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Acknowledging the reception of feedback as an area of growth for me is, honestly, kind of exciting. I want to be someone who takes feedback and criticism in stride and to heart and in turn adopts it into practice. Yet, at the same time and that is something specifically important to me, I also want to be able to detach from feedback and critique and view it as not a personal attack (I don't think it always gets to that point, but in the extreme, it can). I believe it's a matter of shifting my perspective of feedback and putting these ideas into my own practice of offering and delivering feedback and critique toward others. I think practicing giving helpful (ASK-like!) feedback and criticism to others will generate the know-how and karma, if you will, of receiving my own feedback from others (and myself!) that is of quality and productive.
