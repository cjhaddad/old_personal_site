    <h1>Affirming My Values</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h4>March 22, 2015</h4>

    <section>
      <p>
       Achievement, activism, confidence, adventure, helping society, loyalty, integrity, friendships, spirituality, openness, vibrancy, serenity, independence, introspection -- these are the values that stuck out to me in the list of values DBC provided in their prompt for this blog post. Every single one of these words holds weight for me and stand-ins for an abstract idea of the ways in which I was to be in this world. However, two words that were not on the provided values list that I want to focus on are: grace and grit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past 5 to 6 years I have been cultivating a strong Ashtanga yoga practice. In the past three years my practice has significantly developed, and I now have an established daily practice. Mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical transformations abound through this development. And <a href="http://www.ashtangaparampara.org/harmony-lichty.html">as other Ashtangis have noted</a>, a 'beautiful living paradox' emerges from this practice. Right now, a balance between grace and grit is where I am sitting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I imagine a graceful mode of operating in this world to be smooth, fluid, and gracious. Whereas on the other hand, I imagine grittiness to be rough, harsh, and unforgiving. Yet, when I imagine the practice of grace and grit together a beautiful, yet paradoxically balance can occur. The key to this balance is I believe gentleness and forgiveness. In my case, this is primary a gentleness and forgiveness toward self. When I practice being gentle and forgiving toward myself in all matters of being, I experience a deep sense of grace that opens the opportunity for real grit and determination toward reaching a goal to come through. Without the grace and the accompanying gentleness, the grit and determination get out of whack and can result in real (more often than not self-inflicted) physical and emotional pain. When grit is met with grace, a harmonious mode of self-love and transformation occurs, truly creating the circumstances for endless potential.
