       Not too long ago, I found myself in my car driving on the wrong side of a parking lot drive aisle. I stopped, put the car in park, and got out of the car. In a huff I walked around the parking lot ticket machine's barrier and began pressing the ticket button, in an attempt to get the barrier to go up. A security guard and parking lot attendant walked up behind me, one with a phone in their hand looking as if they were getting ready to dial.
     </p>
     <p>
       "Why isn't this going up?"
       "There needs to be the weight of the car in front of it."
       "Please make it go up! I am trying to leave!"
      </p>
      <p>
        This scenario, where I was making a bona-fide ass out of myself, began when the parking lot ticket machine was prompting me to pay $19 to exit. I had just spent a little over three hours at a doctor's appointment and getting x-rays on my shoulder and wrists. The $19 expense came as a surprise to me, since I had my parking ticket validated by my doctor's office. Long story short, I asked the parking lot attendant why it was asking me to pay $19. She said that since I had stayed over 3 hours the validation no longer was valid. She wasn't budging. I yelled, explaining to her how I felt this rule did not take into account the length needed to attend two separate appointments. Needless to say, in my upset state I found myself attempting to avoid paying the $19 by trying to drive around the barrier, move the barrier on the entrance side, and so on. I ended up paying the $19...It took driving less than a block down the road for my anger to turn to straight-up embarrassment and confusion as to why I acted like such a jerk.

       The emotion underlying this incident was fear. Unfeigned fear of financial instability. This incident occurred a couple of months ago, when I was at the beginning of knowingly living off of a finite amount of savings. My last paycheck was in January and the next one was (is) TBD. I was at the beginning of a new career journey and identity shift, where I had recently finished graduate school and just started digging into Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0 curriculum. Money was on my mind. And money was on my mind, because a deep-seated fear that often arises within me is to not have enough...which is intrinsically tied to <em>not being enough.</em> Life was/ is changing (as it always is). My identity as a graduate student and a member of an academic community was ending. While also exciting, I was disassociating myself from a community to which I had been a part for more than 7 years. Adding further tumult to this shift, consistent deposits of paychecks in my bank account for a foreseeable future were ending. And on top of all of this underlying emotion, I had just confronted at the doctor's office my immortality, the physical pain of injury, and the uncertainty of a path to healing. The mind/body/emotion connection behind this scenario is so glaringly obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, back to that $19 that set me over the edge...was $19 going to break my bank account? No. When I returned home about 20 minutes later, I let myself digest what had just happened. Then, I emailed the parking garage manager (because of course I demanded that the parking lot attendant give me their info). I apologized, sincerely. I expressed my concern with their policy, -- since there are multiple doctor's offices in the attached building, and to obtain proper medical care, one could easily spend more than three hours waiting for and receiving treatment. I insisted that a refund for my $19 be issued, and that the refund go to the parking lot attendant who was at the receiving end of my anger.
      </p>

        If I could go back, I would have never yelled at this woman, nor would I had made a scene by trying to exit using the entrance. Especially, I would take back yelling. I would have asked for a manager's name to express my concern, but I would have also paid the $19 and be on my way. No big deal. Stepping back to engage with the underlying emotional currents of this incident gives me a more in-depth perspective of understanding my behavior and reactions. Yelling like I did felt downright awful. Aggressive behavior of any variety is not something I think of when I think of myself, or who I want to be. I strive to practice assertiveness that is infused with patience, understanding, and compassion -- for others, for self. Re-examining this incident allows me to see how my knee-jerk (emphasis on jerk) reactions were rooted in fear, and how in these types of moments stepping back to connect with my breath and current mental/ emotional state can prevent unnecessary conflict.
