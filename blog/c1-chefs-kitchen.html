      Shereef Bishay, during his <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">fireside chat</a>, basically cracked my head open like a coconut and spilled out the two major fears I've been grapping with -- 1) being an imposter and 2) being amongst mediocracy. What this revealed to me is that these fears are so very common. Acknowledging these/my fears as common challenges the special-snowflake mindset to which I know I am succetible. And, seriously, as hard as challenges to my default mindset are, I welcome them! I welcome them, because I retrospectively see how every single mentally challenging experience I have encountered has helped me grow. More often than not, I have trouble recognizing this while I work my way through it. Often, it has taken me years out of a challenging experience to see how it benefited me. I'm practicing bringing this knowledge to present challenges and grounding them in faith that shit just works itself out. For. Real.

      I'm happy to be engaging with an environment that works to immediately recognize and explicitly acknowledge mental blocks/ fears people bring with them. I'm imperfect. Everyone's imperfect. We wrestle with our imperfections often by manifesting fears and myths about ourselves and our world.  Riffing off of Shereef's Kitchen vs. Table metaphor to describe taking ownership of your DBC experience, I see how DBC culture encourages ownership of our fears with the goal to ultimately dispel them. Owning our educational experience and learning environment at DBC includes owning the good, bad, and the ugly we bring to the table. Furthermore, the Kitchen vs. Table metaphor emphasizes the communal aspect of sharing and working through our mental challenges together. I'm very much looking forward to learning and working in this environment to see how it will impact my future self as not only a developer, but a person.
