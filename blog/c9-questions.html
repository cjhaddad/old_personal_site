      <h1>Learning to Ask Good Questions</h1>
      <h2><!-- insert subtitle --></h2>
      <h4>April 5, 2015</h4>

      <section>
        <p>
          Two things come to mind when I contemplate how to ask good questions. The first is the full embracing of the idea that there is no such thing as a "dumb" question and the actions of asking any and all questions that go along with this. For me this act of humility and shedding of the egotistical idea that some how it's not okay to know is the foundation of asking a good question. So, when met with confusion or unknowing, embrace the phrase "I don't know" proudly! Because no one knows everything, and pretending like you do or being ashamed of not know isn't helping you or anyone else around who's also getting their learn on. So, let's "DON'T KNOW" together!
        </p>

          After instilling this foundation of humility and being okay with not knowing, the second key is being clear on your intention when asking a question. This involves asking yourself to be clear in posing your question. And first this requires one to really consider their goal(s). What are you trying to accomplish? Are there different aspects to your question, which requires the breaking down of it into multiple questions? When you get clear on your intention you can better ask your question. One of the outcomes of this clarity is the ability to be both detailed AND concise, which ultimately allows people to understand and answer your question better. These two aspects to asking better questions is a funny, yet productive embracing of both not knowing and knowing!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of learning to code, I think it's important to concisely provide, whether orally/ in-person or textually/ online, just as much context to the problem needed and nothing more. So, instead of droning on and on when speaking or writing out a problem, hone in on the core of what you are trying to accomplish. If there are multiple things you are trying to accomplish, break the question down into multiple questions and pose each at different moments. Smaller, concise, yet detailed questions exhibit your goals, which in turn give people the ability to better help you meet them.
