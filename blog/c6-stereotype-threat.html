      <h1>The Realities of Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <h2><!-- insert subtitle --></h2>
      <h4>March 15, 2015</h4>

      <section>
        <p>
         Stereotype Threat, from my understanding after doing some research, is the idea that a person internalizes the dominant perceptions of their social identity and the prevalent stereotypes of their social identity. This internalization has impacts on how one understands their abilities -- physical, social, intellectual, academic, etc. abilities. This manifests at multiple levels of self-realization and -action, such as career choices, relationships, where and how to live, reactions to certain people, daily desicions (where to grocery shop, whether or not to discuss or disclose certain information about one's self, whether or not get help for something).
       </p>
        <p>
         I watched parts of the Claude M. Steele video and really found the term 'identity contingencies' as a major takeaway in beginning to understand the foundation for stereotype threat: "If you have to deal with certain things, because you have a particular identity, that identity becomes important to you... and how you function on a daily basis." Steele went on to talk about his particular contingencies of identity, especially as an African American. He used the anecdote of being 8 years old and being able to only swim at the pool on Wednesdays, because he was black. He said it is these moments that make particular aspects of your social identity become important to you. I certainly can point to multiple moments in my childhood and adulthood that forced me to realize my "womaness," "not-quite-whiteness," and my "Arabness." Important to note is how Steele asserted that identity contingencies are contextual, situational. My experience of my race was very differently when I travelled in the Arab World or anywhere where brown or black people are the majority.
        </p>
        <p>
          In regards to how stereotype threat affects me in intellectual or academic contexts, I absolutely recognize retrospectively how I made and at times continue to make choices because of my gender. I remember in high school purposely choosing to take easier math classes, because I thought I wasn't good at math. I never really had evidence for this idea that I wasn't good at math. I actually had/ have counter-evidence -- winning equation "board races" in elementary school, getting a school-wide award from my high school math teacher for my achievement in his class, receiving a high score on the math protion of the GRE, etc. Yet, I do feel that while I had counter-evidence, I also don't ever remember being encouraged to take harder math courses, so I didn't. And I do think that led me to form this idea that I was somehow just meh when it comes to math. I think I have indeed gotten to the point where I can reject this idea, because I see plenty evidence that strongly suggests otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the ways I believe I can change an environment where I will be made aware of my social identity and simultaneously need to put to use my math skills is to speak up, speak out, claim vunerabilites AND achievements. I know that one of the ways stereotype threat has affected me is by not speaking up when I'm confused and not celebrating or claiming a rightfully deserved achievement or overcoming of an obstacle. Ultimately, I think in terms of the changes I myself can make it is to be and act in honesty and take actions (even non-action) conciously as it is needed. Furthermore, I believe by doing this myself I contribute to creating and environment that allows other people, particularly other people who have similar social identities, the space to do the same.
